  <h1>My Journey Through the Stars</h1>
  <p class="note">This short text chronicles the past few years of my life, detailing what I’ve done, where I’ve worked,
  and how I’ve enjoyed my time. It's a bit rough around the edges and modestly honest, but if you're interested and have
  the time, this is my story.</p>
  <div>
    <h2>2025</h2>
    <p>After finishing my internship at the ESRI Research & Development Center Stuttgart, formerly known as nFrames, I am now searching for something new.
    To be honest, I feel a bit lost. Working at ESRI R&D Stuttgart would have been a great opportunity, but it also would have been a significant challenge. There is still so much for me to learn in the field of informatics—many concepts remain unfamiliar, and I need more experience across different sectors.
    Being in an office surrounded by people giving their 110% can feel overwhelming, especially when you're just starting out in this field. However, one thing bothered me a lot: the lack of movement and fresh air. I want to be outside, experiencing and seeing things in real life—not just on a 3D mesh model of a city created by an algorithm. </p>
    <p>So, let's see what the future holds. Maybe I'll return to my roots and work as a surveyor again, or perhaps I'll find a new path in the world of informatics.</p>

    <h2>2024</h2>
    <p>In March 2024, I completed my final coding project, ft_transcendence, from the main curriculum. My next project?
    Applying for jobs—a task I'm still tackling. The big question looming over me: "<i>What do I want to do?</i>". Fast
    forward three months, and here I am, writing this little, perhaps inconsequential, text about myself while
    simultaneously launching my first portfolio website for the world to see. Crazy, right? It started as a fun endeavor
    but soon became an all-consuming project with countless details to perfect. In the frenzy, I completely neglected
    the act of applying for internships.</p>
    <br>
    <p>After applying to some companies, i got a Intern position at nFrames, just recently acquired by ESRI. They we're
    working on software using concepts from photogrammetry which maps our reality, producing TrueOrtho's, DSM's, DSM-Meshes and 3D-Meshes. 
    I got the job of introducing a new texture format for the 3D-Meshes and DSM-Meshes (KTX2 or also known as Basis-Universal), 
    which was a challenging experience. I learned a lot about the software's and the processes behind it. 
    I also got to work with some really cool people, which made the experience even better.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Aside from that, I revisited some old passions. I began playing the piano again and resumed learning Spanish, both
    with modest success. I also participated in my first chess tournament out of sheer curiosity. I'm neither terrible
    nor excellent—I just didn't prepare adequately. Maybe my lack of routine is hampering my productivity and
    discipline, or perhaps it's the allure of the YouTube algorithm. One day, I believe I’ll have it all figured out
    (winking smiley).</p>
    <p>The books I read: "Emil and the Detectives" by Erich Kästner | "Die Krähe" by Kader Abdolah | "The Little Prince"
    by Antoine de Saint-Exupery | "Eine kurze Geschichte der Künstlichen Intelligenz" by Michael Wildenhain |
    "Qualityland" by Marc-Uwe Kling</p>

    <h2>2023</h2>
    <p>This was a very interesting and eventful year.</p>
    <p>It began unlike any other. With new responsibilities to manage, numerous changes, and some mild stress related to
      my time at 42. While it might not sound fun to some, I take life at a relaxed pace and try not to stress too much.
      If I had to describe the year in one word, it would be: amazeballs. Changes are a natural part of life, stress is
      manageable, and living in the moment truly helped.</p>
    <p>From moving out of my parents' house, playing tunes at parties, and enjoying video games with friends, to visiting
      various places, participating in hackathons, and tackling the challenges of Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions—2023
      was filled with memorable experiences. These events taught me a lot and helped me grow in countless ways.</p>
    <p>The books I read: (To be filled out).</p>
    <p>All in all, I’d rate this year a solid Green on a scale from crow to 11.</p>

    <h2>2022</h2>
    <p>“In any given moment we have two options: to step forward into growth or step back into safety.” — Abraham Maslow
    </p>
    <p>“Those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.” — George Bernard Shaw</p>
    <p>Some random quotes about change to make me sound wiser than I really am. Nonetheless, these quotes highlight an
      important point: this year took me by surprise and dramatically changed my small cosmos.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I began the year by quitting my job as a surveyor at a regional council. I enjoyed the environment and the
        people there, but the outdated, bureaucratic processes were stifling.</li>
      <li>So, I decided to take the piscine (entrance exam) for 42Heilbronn. It was undoubtedly one of the craziest four
        weeks I have ever experienced.</li>
      <li>Getting accepted and studying at 42Heilbronn was exhilarating. The initial hype, the emotions, and the energy
        everyone radiated were unforgettable.</li>
      <li>I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I've always wanted to start drawing.</p>
    <p>Since my diagnosis, I carry a shoulder bag everywhere I go. Inside, there's a pen and a book, which I use to draw
      during my adventures. Drawing has definitely helped me cope with everything and has also enhanced my visual skills.

    <h2>2021</h2>
    <p>El español es bonito.</p>
    <p>That's what everyone thinks when choosing a new language to learn, I guess.</p>
    <p>Aprender español requiere motivación.</p>
    <p>That's what we should truly focus on, I guess.</p>
    <p>Either way, I completed my apprenticeship as a surveyor. I graduated and earned my <i>Fachhochschulreife</i>, a
      German certificate that allows me to study at universities.</p>
    <p>I excelled in GeoData and found it incredibly enjoyable. Working on projects with publicly available data or
      collecting data myself, especially if it had a georeference, was fascinating. I often wondered if I should have
      pursued an apprenticeship as a geomaticist or continued studying geomatics at university.</p>
    <p>My time at the regional council was unforgettable. I met a wide variety of people, saw numerous projects with many
      participants, and learned about so many specialized technologies and software. All in all, it was an exhilarating
      experience.</p>

    <h2>2020</h2>
    <p>Do I even remember this year (it's been four years now)? Time passes without you even acknowledging it.</p>
    <p>It's crazy when you think about it.</p>
    <p>In our way-too-fast world, with time being a driving factor and constantly in your face, looking back feels like a
      hypnotic, distant dream.</p>
    <p>Am I the only one who feels this way, or does everyone notice the swift passage of time?</p>
    <p>Reflecting on my work life, the second and third years of my apprenticeship were probably my favorite years. You
      finally understand things and can do them on your own. You get some responsibilities, yay!</p>
