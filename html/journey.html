  <h1>My Journey Through the Stars</h1>
  <p class="note">This short text chronicles the past few years of my life, detailing what I’ve done, where I’ve worked,
  and how I’ve enjoyed my time. It's a bit rough around the edges and modestly honest, but if you're interested and have
  the time, this is my story.</p>

    <h2>2024</h2>
    <p>In March 2024, I completed my final coding project, ft_transcendence, from the main curriculum. My next project?
    Applying for jobs—a task I'm still tackling. The big question looming over me: "<i>What do I want to do?</i>". Fast
    forward three months, and here I am, writing this little, perhaps inconsequential, text about myself while
    simultaneously launching my first portfolio website for the world to see. Crazy, right? It started as a fun endeavor
    but soon became an all-consuming project with countless details to perfect. In the frenzy, I completely neglected
    the act of applying for internships.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Aside from that, I revisited some old passions. I began playing the piano again and resumed learning Spanish, both
    with modest success. I also participated in my first chess tournament out of sheer curiosity. I'm neither terrible
    nor excellent—I just didn't prepare adequately. Maybe my lack of routine is hampering my productivity and
    discipline, or perhaps it's the allure of the YouTube algorithm. One day, I believe I’ll have it all figured out
    (winking smiley).</p>
    <p>The books I read: "Emil and the Detectives" by Erich Kästner | "Die Krähe" by Kader Abdolah | "The Little Prince"
    by Antoine de Saint-Exupery | "Eine kurze Geschichte der Künstlichen Intelligenz" by Michael Wildenhain |
    "Qualityland" by Marc-Uwe Kling</p>

    <h2>2023</h2>
    <p>This was a very interesting and eventful year.</p>
    <p>It began unlike any other. With new responsibilities to manage, numerous changes, and some mild stress related to
      my time at 42. While it might not sound fun to some, I take life at a relaxed pace and try not to stress too much.
      If I had to describe the year in one word, it would be: amazeballs. Changes are a natural part of life, stress is
      manageable, and living in the moment truly helped.</p>
    <p>From moving out of my parents' house, playing tunes at parties, and enjoying video games with friends, to visiting
      various places, participating in hackathons, and tackling the challenges of Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions—2023
      was filled with memorable experiences. These events taught me a lot and helped me grow in countless ways.</p>
    <p>The books I read: (To be filled out).</p>
    <p>All in all, I’d rate this year a solid Green on a scale from crow to 11.</p>

    <p>“In any given moment we have two options: to step forward into growth or step back into safety.” — Abraham Maslow
    </p>
    <p>“Those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.” — George Bernard Shaw.</p>
    <p>“Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.” — Stephen Hawking.</p>
    <p>Some random quotes about change so I sound wiser than I really am. Still, this year brought a lot of change into
      my small little cosmos.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It started with quitting my job as a surveyor at a regional council.</li>
      <li>Doing the piscine (entrance exam) for 42Heilbronn.</li>
      <li>Getting accepted and now studying at 42Heilbronn.</li>
      <li>Getting diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.</li>
      <li>And just some other regular struggles everyone my age has.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2021</h2>
    <p>El <i>español</i> es bonito.</p>
    <p>That's what everyone thinks when they want to learn a new language, I guess.</p>
    <p>Either way, my apprenticeship as a surveyor was finished. Graduated and left with a <i>Fachhochschulreife</i>
      (some German certificate that lets me study at universities, kinda).</p>
    <p>I did my best in the topic of GeoData and found a lot of fun in it. I also wondered if I should have done an
      apprenticeship as a geomaticist.</p>
    <p>Working in the Flurneuordnungsamt was a really interesting time that I won't forget. I met a lot of different
      characters, saw many projects with a lot of people involved, and learned about so many specific technologies and
      software. All in all, it was a crazy time there.</p>

  <div>
    <h2>2020</h2>
    <p>Do I even remember this (it's been 4 years now)? Time passes without you even acknowledging it.</p>
    <p>Just crazy when you come to think about it.</p>
    <p>In our way-too-fast world, with time pinned in your face, looking back feels like a hypnotic, distant dream.</p>
    <p>Am I the only one who feels like this, or does everyone acknowledge the passage of time?</p>
    <p>Coming back to my work life, yeah, the second and third years of my apprenticeship were probably my favorite
      years. You finally understand things and can do them on your own. You get some responsibilities, yay!</p>
